I'm Zach, and I'm a Network Architect, Business Owner, and Home Lab Techie. I like to play with a lot of different technologies from programming, networking, servers, raspberry pi, to home automation and sensors.

I also do Business IT Consulting and WISP consulting, helping businesses and network operators automate and secure their networks.

I get involved in a lot of different projects and solutions due to my wide variety of interests in technology, which you'll see reflected in my repositories.
